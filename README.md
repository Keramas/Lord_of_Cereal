## Java serialization tool for creating encrypted and HMAC protected payloads.

## Overview:
This tool is meant for situations when the encryption and/or HMAC secret is leaked from the server (through LFI or other means), and will allow for payloads to be generated and sent to the server.


## Payload options:
* Powershell
* Bash



## To do:
* Add support for other encryption methods
* Add support for other HMAC digest methods
* Add separate option for when the encryption secret and HMAC secret differ
* Add switches for Java payload types
* Add Python and Perl support as payload options
